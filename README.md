#### Key Takeaways
-	Cleaned, structured, and visualized data on median earnings by sex, occupation, and educational attainment from the U.S. Census Bureau, spanning 2017 â€“ 2022
-	Implemented data visualization strategies in Tableau to highlight the current gender pay gaps for the full-time, employed population, concluding females earned, on average, 79% that of male counterparts in Iowa, and 82% in the United States

#### Summary
This was my final project in my data visualization course in Tableau. I was tasked to find any dataset of interest and create a compelling story and utilize advanced Tableau functionality. I utilized advanced Tableau techniques in order to visualize the current wage gap in the United States, and specifically Iowa. I analyzed U.S. Census Bureau datasets from 2017 - 2021 on median earnings by occupation and sex for the full-time, year-round, civilian employed population 16 years and over as documented in Table S2412, as well as 2017 - 2021 datasets on sex by educational attainment representative of the population 25 years and over as documented in Table B15002. 

Through my analyses, I found Iowa females to earn, on average, 79% of what their male counterparts earned (and 82% in the United States). Of the 25 occupations analyzed, I found that over the 5-year period, there were 5 unique instances where females had greater median earnings, on average, than their male counterparts in Iowa. There were no instances in the United States as a whole. Interestingly, females in Iowa attained greater rates of education, on average, when compared to males.
